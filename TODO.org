* TODO - various tasks which need to be worked on

When you work on this and finished an item, make sure to
point it out in this file.

** */*

- Update to EAPI 6.

** net-misc/gnunet

- Debug the openrc service and improve it to function like intended
  (see post setup notes). Either fix the service or adjust the ebuild.

** net-p2p/retroshare

- Check if we are affected by the annual sourceforge stupidity of changing
  URLs of download locations.

** sys-apps/guix

- Debug the openrc service!
- Check the ebuild for mistakes.

** sys-apps/guix-bin

- Make it functional.

** www-plugins/*

- Fix this: use() is wrong in the ebuilds.
** dev-perl/Net-PSYC

- fix the last minor problems in Makefile and/or expand it -> ng0 will do it.
- psycion segfaults when torified. debug this.

** gnutls + guile

- drop it once #355355 has been sorted out upstream
- now: update (sync) gnutls with portage
