youbroketheinternet-overlay
===========================

We produce original ebuilds for some items but we also borrow and
build from other sources, then republish them via a secure authen-
tication medium, a Tor onion. Since all of git, rsync and https
protocols can be man in the middled, using a self-authenticating
onion is the way to go. Makes you nervous? Why.. this is not about
anonymity. All the known problems related to onion services are
about de-anonymization. There are no known cases of authenticity
failure, which is what we expect from this. So we copy other
people's ebuilds because we don't want to integrate insecure
overlays into our operating system build procedures. So, if your
ebuild is in here, it's an honor for us to be hosting a copy.

Please drop by
	    irc://loupsycedyglgamf.onion:67/welcome
	 or http://loupsycedyglgamf.onion/PSYC/
	 or torify telnet loupsycedyglgamf.onion
for feedback and 'git pull' offers.

Git was intended for everyone to run their own little git server
and pull from each other. Git was NOT invented for centralized
commercial social networking clouds such as github! If you want
to submit a patch to this overlay, pass it in form of a textual
patch or make your copy of this git available on your own onion.
Github is not a safe infrastructure for a GNU Internet.


=== dev-perl/Net-PSYC ===

Perl implementation of the PSYC protocol together with

- git2psyc: git hook to deliver PSYC notifications on commit
- psycion: curses based PSYC client
- psycmp3: PSYC-controllable console mp3 player
- remotor: text-based remote control for Tor routers
- syslog2psyc: forwarding of syslog events via PSYC

and several more nifty tools for automation of
notification and messaging.

== dev-lang/psyclpc ==

LPC bytecode interpreter used by psyced. Works also for
implementing Multi-User Dungeon games (MUDs).

== dev-libs/openssl ==

The regular portage openssl files disallow the use of certain
elliptic curve cryptography that pybitmessage happens to need.

== dev-qt/qzxing ==

Qt library for QR code generation and decoding.

== dev-scheme/guile ==

Guix needs newer guile to compile, portage needs to fix
bug #355355 one day. Extended testing phase, use at your
own risk. You can use the -r3 and -r99 versions with the
eselect, but as for numerous breakage occurences of autoconf
those are now masked in the overlay.

== app-eselect/eselect-guile ==

Original eselect for use with our -r99 guile versions. Like
the Guile ebuilds we have to point out that they were tested
but breakage might occur as the ebuilds are in extended
testing phase. Use at your own risk.

== eclass/git-r3 ==

Added 'git fsck' after fetch to protect from MITM attacks
during git network transactions. This is used by ebuilds
that compile from git rather than from tarballs.

Added support for fetching gits from onions using torsocks.
You can generally fetch gits via Tor if you define
	EGIT_SOCKS="torsocks"
in your env.

== eclass/mozilla-addon ==

Used by the Torbrowser add-ons below. You need to define
the "target_torbrowser" USE flag if you want the add-ons
to be installed directly into your browser.

You can also symlink the extensions manually into your
`$HOME/.mozilla/{torbrowser,firefox}/$profile/extensions/`
folder.

With the newer versions of Firefox and Torbrowser you
even have to disable `xpinstall.signatures.required` in
about:config. Thank you Firefox for being paranoid against
your own hard disk.

== media-libs/vid-stab ==

Remove camera shaking from shaken videos. A plug-in for
kdenlive. Simply recompile kdenlive after installing this.
kdenlive should have it in its dependencies, but in fact
the kdenlive ebuild is missing several dependencies.

== media-sound/rxaudio-bin ==

A *shareware* from 1998: A remote controllable MP3 engine
used by psycmp3 from dev-perl/Net-PSYC. Source code was never
released. Original website has disappeared. But it works.

== media-video/miro ==

Podcast TV.

== net-im/qtox ==

Person-to-person encrypted telephony application.

== net-im/ricochet ==

Metadata protecting Instant Messenger tool operating
peer-to-peer over Tor Hidden Services without using
servers.

== net-im/toxic ==

Person-to-person encrypted telephony application with CLI-UI.

== net-im/utox ==

Person-to-person encrypted telephony application.

== net-irc/psyced ==

Server for federated messaging and chat using PSYC, IRC,
XMPP and other protocols.

== net-libs/gnutls ==

Guix needs to have Guile-2 bindings of GNUtls. The one in portage
currently links to a Guile-2 that might brick your system.

== net-misc/gnunet ==

GNUnet is a mesh network routing system not limited to peer-
to-peer usage, so it belongs into net-misc instead of net-p2p.
Usage is a bit unorthodox, but it provides anonymous file
sharing/publication for a start.

== net-misc/gnunet-gtk ==

While compiling from source works great, the ebuilds produce
some mysterious error messages. Please help to figure out
what the problem is. Luckily this package is optional.

== net-misc/gnurl ==

Trimmed down variation of curl without all the cruft. GNUnet
uses this.

== net-misc/powwow ==

Enhanced telnet client with automation macros for interaction
with Multi-User Domains (MUDs). Nowadays it is frequently used
as a text-based messaging client with psyced's telnet access.

== net-misc/onioncircuits ==

Another fine item from MeisterP's torbrowser overlay.

== net-p2p/pybitmessage ==

Cryptographic anonymizing text publication system. Not a lot better
than PGP concerning one-to-one communications (it lacks forward
secrecy) but its strength is clearly in the ability to broadcast
from few senders to many recipients. The latest version also works
over Tor, but that is actually quite a strain on your Tor router
and will only hide the fact that you are using Bitmessage, it
probably does not increase your messaging anonymity.

== net-p2p/retroshare ==

With the new 0.6 series RetroShare finally has built-in Tor
support. Still, it is far too complicated to configure. This
needs to get a lot simpler. RetroShare is lightweight and
reasonably safe if used in Tor-only mode with DHT disabled.
For generic file sharing it's better to use GNUnet.

== net-proxy/torsocks ==

Make proxy-unaware applications access the Internet through
Tor. Includes the notorious 'torify' command.

== sys-apps/guix ==

GNU Guix is a package manager. It's also an operating system
(GNU GuixSD). Guix aims to provide updates via GNUnet in the
future. Currently this ebuild and sys-apps/guix-binary are
open for debugging here, please provide us with input.

== sys-apps/guix-bin ==

GNU Guix is a package manager for reproducible building. It
is therefore legitimate to use its binary installation as
you can check its correctness later, by rebuilding the exact
identical binary files.

== www-client/torbrowser ==

By fulfilling most requirements of protocol standards, all web browsers
are currently tuned to conspire with web servers to spy on you, even
if you use them in combination with the Tor anonymization system.
Torbrowser is the only instrument that separates your browsing activity
tab by tab into separate Tor identities, disallowing big brother to
correlate your activities. In other words, this is the only acceptable
web browser in existence as of 2015-2016.

== www-client/torbrowser-launcher ==

I don't use this currently.

== www-plugins/certpatrol ==

Torbrowser/Firefox add-on that monitors HTTPS certificates for
unexpected changes and warns of man-in-the-middle attacks.

== www-plugins/cfc ==

Torbrowser/Firefox add-on that circumvents Cloudflare CAPTCHAs
and other nuisance of the broken web.

== www-plugins/exif_viewer ==

Torbrowser/Firefox add-on to inspect EXIF image metadata while browsing
the web.

== www-servers/onionshare ==

One more great ebuild from Poncho.

== x11-misc/interrobang ==

A tiny launcher menu packing a big bang (syntax).
