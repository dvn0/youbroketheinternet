youbroketheinternet-overlay
===========================

Overlay that borrows and adapts ebuilds from various sources and
republishes them via a secure authentication medium. Since all of
git, rsync and https protocols can be man in the middled, using
a self-authenticating onion is the way to go. Makes you nervous?
Why.. this is not about anonymity. All the known problems related
to onion services are about de-anonymization. There are no known
cases of authenticity failure, which is what we expect from this.

Please drop by 
    irc://loupsycedyglgamf.onion:67/youbroketheinternet
 or http://loupsycedyglgamf.onion/PSYC/?room=youbroketheinternet
 or torify telnet loupsycedyglgamf.onion + /c youbroketheinternet
for feedback and 'git pull' offers.

Git was intended for everyone to run their own little git server
and pull from each other. Git was NOT invented for centralized
commercial social networking clouds such as github! If you want
to submit a patch to this overlay, pass it in form of a textual
patch or make your copy of this git available on your own onion.
Github is not a safe infrastructure for a GNU Internet.


== dev-libs/openssl ==

The regular portage openssl files disallow the use of elliptic
curve cryptography. I don't understand such utter madness.
pybitmessage needs openssl with proper ECC.

== net-misc/gnunet ==

GNUnet is a mesh network routing system not limited to peer-
to-peer usage, so it belongs into net-misc instead of net-p2p.
Usage is a bit unorthodox, but it provides anonymous file
sharing/publication for a start.

== net-misc/gnunet-gtk ==

While compiling from source works great, the ebuilds produce
some mysterious error messages. Please help to figure out
what the problem is. Luckily this package is optional.

== net-misc/gnurl ==

Trimmed down variation of curl without all the cruft. GNUnet
uses this.

== net-p2p/pybitmessage ==

Cryptographic anonymizing text publication system. Not a lot better
than PGP concerning one-to-one communications (it lacks forward
secrecy) but its strength is clearly in the ability to broadcast
from few senders to many recipients. The latest version also works
over Tor, but that is actually quite a strain on your Tor router
and will only hide the fact that you are using Bitmessage, it
probably does not increase your messaging anonymity.

== net-p2p/retroshare ==

With the new 0.6 series RetroShare finally has built-in Tor
support. Still, it is far too complicated to configure. This
needs to get a lot simpler. RetroShare is lightweight and
reasonably safe if used in Tor-only mode with DHT disabled.
For generic file sharing it's better to use GNUnet.

== www-client/torbrowser ==

By fulfilling most requirements of protocol standards, all web browsers
are currently tuned to conspire with web servers to spy on you, even
if you use them in combination with the Tor anonymization system.
Torbrowser is the only instrument that separates your browsing activity
tab by tab into separate Tor identities, disallowing big brother to
correlate your activities. In other words, this is the only acceptable
web browser in existence as of 2015.

== www-client/torbrowser-launcher ==

I don't use this currently.
