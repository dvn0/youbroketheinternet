rxaudio: My only little guilty pleasure.

The rxaudio binary is originally from around 1997. It has 
served a reliable service on my systems ever since and is
used by psycmp3 to fulfil the job of a flexible command
line mp3 player.

I wouldn't mind having psycmp3 use a free software API
but somebody has to do the porting. Last time I checked
the free APIs weren't as advanced and flexible as the
xaudio API from back then, so some functionality would
disappear.

It is extremily unlikely that the small business that 
released the xaudio package back then implanted any
backdoors, so I don't worry about this little imperfect
dependency here.
